# Daily Log: 10/01/2025 - Sprint 2: Data Ingestion Engine Debugging

## 🎯 **Objective**
To successfully implement and verify the `DataIngestionEngine` and ensure the test suite is fully functional.

---

## ❗ **Errors Encountered & Solutions**

This log details the debugging process for the `DataIngestionEngine` and its test suite.

### 1. **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` (Persistent)**
-   **Problem**: Python could not find the `src` package when importing modules, even after creating `src/__init__.py`.
-   **Attempted Solutions**:
    1.  Created `src/__init__.py`. (Did not immediately resolve the error).
    2.  Removed redundant `tests/test_ingestion_engine.py` file. (Did not immediately resolve the error).
-   **Final Solution**: Running `pytest` with `PYTHONPATH=.` explicitly added the project root to Python's path, resolving the import error.

### 2. **`TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not AsyncMock` (Test Setup)**
-   **Problem**: The `DataIngestionEngine` constructor was being called with an `AsyncMock` object for `config_path` in a `unittest` style test file.
-   **Solution**: Overwrote the `unittest` style `tests/pipeline/test_ingestion_engine.py` with the correct `pytest` style test content.

### 3. **`AssertionError: assert 13 == 2` (Incorrect Chunk Count)**
-   **Problem**: `test_ingestion_from_gcp` was failing because `ingest_batch` found more files than expected (13 instead of 2) due to `test_large_file_ingestion_performance` creating `large_file.bin`.
-   **Attempted Solution**: Manually cleaned `test_data/` directory. (Test passed after manual cleanup).
-   **Final Solution**: Modified `setup_test_data` fixture to explicitly remove the `test_data/` directory at the beginning, ensuring a clean test environment for every run.

### 4. **`AssertionError: assert 11 == (1024 // 100)` (Integer Division in Test Assertion)**
-   **Problem**: The assertion in `test_large_file_ingestion_performance` used integer division (`//`) instead of `math.ceil` to calculate the expected number of chunks, leading to an incorrect expected value.
-   **Solution**: Added `import math` and changed the assertion to `assert len(chunks) == math.ceil(1024 / engine.chunk_size_mb)`.

### 5. **`IndentationError: unexpected indent` (Test File Syntax)**
-   **Problem**: An `IndentationError` occurred in `test_large_file_ingestion_performance` due to incorrect indentation of `assert` and `print` statements.
-   **Solution**: Corrected the indentation of the `assert` and `print` statements.

### 6. **`AssertionError: assert 0 > 0` (Missing Test Data in Tests)**
-   **Problem**: `test_node_unavailable_during_ingestion` and `test_retry_on_transient_failure` were failing because they were not using the `setup_test_data` fixture, resulting in no test files being present for ingestion.
-   **Solution**: Added `setup_test_data` as an argument to both test functions.

### 7. **`green` Not Discovering `pytest` Tests**
-   **Problem**: `green tests/pipeline/test_ingestion_engine.py` was not discovering `pytest` style tests.
-   **Solution**: Recommended using `pytest` directly for `pytest` style tests. Created a `run_all_tests.sh` script to orchestrate both `green` (for `unittest` tests) and `pytest` (for `pytest` tests) for a unified test execution.

## ✅ **Accomplishments**

-   Successfully implemented the `DataIngestionEngine` in `src/pipeline/ingestion_engine.py`.
-   Successfully implemented a comprehensive test suite for the `DataIngestionEngine` in `tests/pipeline/test_ingestion_engine.py`.
-   All `DataIngestionEngine` tests now pass when run with `pytest`.
-   Created a unified test runner script (`tests/run_all_tests.sh`) to execute both `unittest` and `pytest` style tests.
-   The `DataIngestionEngine` is now fully functional and verified, ready for integration into the larger system.
