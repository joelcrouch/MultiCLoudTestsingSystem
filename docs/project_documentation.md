# High-Performance Data Pipeline Orchestrator
## Project Overview & Technical Specification

### ðŸŽ¯ **What This System Actually Does**

The Data Pipeline Orchestrator is a **distributed system that coordinates the movement and processing of large-scale ML training data across multiple compute nodes**. Think of it as the "air traffic control" for your ML training data.

**Real-World Problem It Solves:**
- When training large ML models (like GPT, Claude, etc.), you need to move terabytes of training data efficiently across hundreds/thousands of machines
- Data needs to be ingested, preprocessed, distributed to training nodes, and stored reliably
- If any node fails, the system must automatically recover without losing data or stopping training
- Engineers need visibility into performance bottlenecks to optimize training speed

### ðŸ“‹ **Functional Requirements**

#### **Core Data Movement Operations**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Pull training data from multiple sources (S3, HDFS, local storage)
2. **Data Processing**: Transform, validate, and chunk data for distributed training
3. **Data Distribution**: Efficiently route processed data to available training nodes
4. **Data Persistence**: Store checkpoints and processed data with fault tolerance

#### **System Management**
1. **Node Discovery**: Automatically detect and register new compute nodes
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload based on node capacity and network topology
3. **Failure Detection**: Monitor node health and trigger automatic failover
4. **Performance Optimization**: Dynamic routing and resource allocation

#### **Observability & Control**
1. **Real-time Metrics**: Track throughput, latency, and system efficiency
2. **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all nodes for debugging
3. **Pipeline Control**: Start/stop/pause operations across the entire cluster
4. **Alert Management**: Notify operators of performance degradation or failures
